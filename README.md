# Counter Strike Stats with Playframework 3

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you will need the correct version of Java and sbt. The tutorial requires:

* Java Software Developer's Kit (SE) 17
* sbt 1.10.11

To check your Java version, enter the following in a command window:

```bash
java -version
```

To check your sbt version, enter the following in a command window:

```bash
sbt sbtVersion
```

If you do not have the required versions, follow these links to obtain them:

* [Java SE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html)
* [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)

## Build and run the project

This example Play project was created from a seed template. It includes all Play components and an Pekko HTTP server. The project is also configured with filters for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection and security headers.

To build and run the project:

1. Use a command window to change into the example project directory, for example: `cd counter-strike-play`

2. Build the project. Enter: `sbt run` or `./gradlew playRun`. The project builds and starts the embedded HTTP server. Since this downloads libraries and dependencies, the amount of time required depends partly on your connection's speed.

3. After the message `Server started, ...` displays, enter the following URL in a browser: <http://localhost:9000>

The Play application responds: `Welcome to Playframework 3 Project!`

## Server backend

By default, the project uses the Pekko HTTP Server backend. To switch to the Netty Server backend, enable the `PlayNettyServer` sbt plugin in the `build.sbt` file.
In the `build.sbt` of this project, you'll find a commented line for this setting; simply uncomment it to make the switch.
For more detailed information, refer to the Play Framework [documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/3.0.x/Server).
